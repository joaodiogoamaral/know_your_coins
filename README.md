# know_your_coins
This repository contains a tool that allows its users to have an understanding of some important investment market metrics (mostly sentiment for now), and also allows them to track their portfolio on supported Cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as brokers. 


# Supported Exchanges

  * Kraken
  * Binance (ongoing)

# Supported Brokers
  None at the moment.

# Known Issues
  * Binance API does not allow its consumers to get the balance of staked assets. That includes Polkadot Slot Auctions and also ETH staking (besides all other PoS Currencies). 

# To Do:

  * Add CoinMarketCal meaningful events to frontend.
  * Create a config file sample and add to repository
  * Translate json fields to actual crypto tickers on frontend. 


# Roadmap:
  
  * Move application to docker containers. 
  * Add logarithmic scale metric to the application. 
  * Add support for tracking Degiro investments.
  * Add support for Binance Tracking on Frontend
